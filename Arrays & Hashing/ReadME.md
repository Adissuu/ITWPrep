# Learning Outcomes
## So what tips do I have in my pocket now that I have started to practice Arrays & Hashing?
### 1. Use a set to remove duplicates
### 2. Use a dictionary to store values and their indices/frequencies
### 3. Try and draw a potential solution instead of diving in the code right away. This will help come up with a more optimized algorithm.
